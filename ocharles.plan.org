#+TITLE: Zero to Quake 3

Trying to build as much of Quake 3 as I can using Haskell & Vulkan.

* Todo
** [ ] A DSL for building Vulkan structs :refactoring:
** [ ] Resource cleanup :correctness:
** [ ] Build a render pass :progress:
** [ ] Add the validation layer :correctness:
** [ ] Find out how to correctly use vulkan-loader

It currently requires me to change =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= to contain
vulkan-loader.so.
